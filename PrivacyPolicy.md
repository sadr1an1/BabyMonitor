Privacy Policy

Adrian Stanescu built Baby Monitor IOS app as a non commercial app.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my application.

Security

If you choose to use my application, then you must know that the application never stores any personal information and data. So, there is no recording of audio or video. The streams only transmit data to the peered devices inside the same wifi.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
